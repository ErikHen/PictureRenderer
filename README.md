# ASP.Net Picture Renderer
The Picture renderer makes it easy to optimize images in (pixel) size, quality, file size, and image format. 
Images will be responsive, and can be lazy loaded.
It's a light-weight library, suitable for Blazor Webassembly.

The Picture Renderer renders an [HTML picture element](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015). The picture element presents a set of images in different sizes and formats. 
It‚Äôs then up to the browser to select the most appropriate image depending on screen resolution, viewport width, network speed, and the rules that you set up.

If you are unfamiliar with the details of the Picture element i highly recommed reading
 [this](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015) and/or [this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/).

Picture Renderer is used together with [SixLabors/ImageSharp.Web](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Web) to create the different image versions (support for other image processors may be added in the future).

## Why should you use this?
You want the images on your web site to be as optimized as possible. For example, having the most optimal image for any screen size and device type, 
will make the web page load faster, 
and is a [Google search rank factor](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/google-images#optimize-for-speed).
<br>
 
The Picture Renderer works very well together with a CMS where you might not be in control of the exact images that will be used. 
The content editor doesn't have to care about what aspect ratio, or size, the image has. The most optimal image will always be used.<br>

### Webp format
The rendered picture element will also contain [webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) versions of the image. By default this will be rendered for jpg images.

## How to use
* Add [ImageSharp.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web/) to the slution for the server that will take care of the actual resizing of the images (see also [Setup and configuration](https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp.web/gettingstarted.html#setup-and-configuration)).
* Add [PictureRenderer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PictureRenderer/) to the solution that renders the HTML (which may of course be the same as the solution that does the image resizing).
* Create Picture profiles for the different types of images that you have on your web site. A Picture profile describes how an image should be scaled in various cases. <br>
You could for example create Picture profiles for: ‚ÄúTop hero image‚Äù, ‚ÄúTeaser image‚Äù, ‚ÄúImage gallery thumbnail‚Äù.
* Let Picture Renderer create the picture HTML element.

### Picture profile
```c#
using PictureRenderer.Profiles;

public static class PictureProfiles
{
    // Sample image
    // Up to 640 pixels viewport width, the picture width will be 100% of the viewport minus 40 pixels.
    // Up to 1200 pixels viewport width, the picture width will be 320 pixels.
    // On larger viewport width, the picture width will be 750 pixels.
    // Note that picture width is not the same as image width (but it can be, on screens with a "device pixel ratio" of 1).
    public static readonly ImageSharpProfile SampleImage = new() 
        {
            SrcSetWidths = new[] { 320, 640, 750, 1500 },
            Sizes = new[] { "(max-width: 640px) 100vw", "(max-width: 1200px) 320px", "750px" },
            AspectRatio = 1.777 // 16:9 = 16/9 = 1.777
        };

    // Top hero
    // Picture width is always 100% of the viewport width.
    public static readonly ImageSharpProfile TopHero = new()
        {
            SrcSetWidths = new[] { 1024, 1366, 1536, 1920 },
            Sizes = new[] { "100vw" },
            AspectRatio = 2
        };

    // Thumbnail
    // Thumbnail is always 150px wide. But the browser may still select the 300px image for a high resolution screen (e.g. mobile or tablet screens).
    public static readonly ImageSharpProfile Thumbnail = new()
        {
            SrcSetWidths = new[] { 150, 300 },
            Sizes = new[] { "150px" },
            AspectRatio = 1  //square image (equal height and width).
        };

    // Multi-image
    // Show different images depending on media conditions (e.g. different image for mobile sized screen).
    public static readonly ImageSharpProfile SampleImage2 = new()
    {
        MultiImageMediaConditions = new[] { new MediaCondition("(min-width: 1200px)", 600), new MediaCondition("(min-width: 600px)", 300) },
        AspectRatio = 1.777
    };
}
```

* **SrcSetWidths (for single image)** ‚Äì The different image widths you want the browser to select from. These values are used when rendering the srcset attribute. Ignored when rendering multiple images.
* **Sizes (for single image)** ‚Äì Define the size (width) the image should be according to a set of ‚Äúmedia conditions‚Äù (similar to css media queries). Values are used to render the sizes attribute. Ignored when rendering multiple images.
* **MultiImageMediaConditions (for multi image)** - Define image widths for different media conditions. 
* **AspectRatio (optional)** ‚Äì The wanted aspect ratio of the image (width/height). Ex: An image with aspect ratio 16:9 = 16/9 = 1.777.
* **CreateWebpForFormat (optional)** - The image formats that should be offered as webp versions. Jpg format is aded by default.
* **Quality (optional)** - Image quality. Lower value = less file size. Not valid for all image formats. Default value: `80`.
* **FallbackWidth (optional)** ‚Äì This image width will be used in browsers that don‚Äôt support the picture element. Will use the largest width if not set.
* **ImageDecoding (optional)** - Value for img element `decoding` attribute. Default value: `async`.
* **ImgWidthHeight (optional)** - If true, `width` and `height` attributes will be rendered on the img element.

### Render picture element
Render the picture element by calling `Picture.Render`
<br>
#### Parameters
* **ImagePath/ImagePaths** - Single image path, or array of image paths.
* **profile** - The Picture profile that specifies image widths, etc..
* **altText (optional)** - Img element `alt` attribute.
* **lazyLoading (optional)** - Type of lazy loading. Currently only [browser native lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading#images_and_iframes) (or none).
* **focalPoint/focalPoints (optional)** - Use focal point when image is cropped (multiple points for multiple image paths). 
* **cssClass (optional)** - Css class for img element. 

Picture.Render returns a string, so you need to make sure the string is not HTML-escaped by using Html.Raw or similar.
<br> 

Basic MVC/Razor page sample
```
@Html.Raw(Picture.Render("/img/test.jpg", PictureProfiles.SampleImage)) 
```
<br>

Basic Blazor sample
```
@((MarkupString)Picture.Render("/images/test.jpg", PictureProfiles.SampleImage))
```

## Version history
* **3.2** Changing some things reported as warnings by Sonarcloud.
* **3.1** Making PictureRenderer.ImageFormat public. Don't understand why it was internal in the first place üòä.

* **3.0** Possible to have multiple focal points when having multiple images. Minor breaking change, so bump major version. <br> 
* **2.2** Added support for "art direction" (e.g. having completely different images for different screen sizes) <br> 
* **2.1** Just adding some more XML commens + added png format constant. <br> 
* **2.0** Support for WebP format. Removed deprecated property. Added unit tests. <br> 
Note that you need to use ImageSharp.Web v2.0+ for WebP support.
* **1.3** Added possibility to render `class`, `decoding`, and `width` + `height` attributes on the img element. <br>
* **1.2.2** Bugfix (unit tests would have found this issue... lesson learned)<br>
* **1.2** Renamed picture profile property to "Sizes" (old name marked as deprecated).<br>
